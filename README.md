# ros2-docker-modular-data-acquisition-for-av
Modular data acquisition architecture for autonomous vehicle (AV) research activities. The system uses Docker containerization for software isolation and ROS2 as the real-time communication middleware. It includes containerized software stacks for LiDAR, Stereo Camera, GNSS, IMU, and CAN-bus. It was validated on a AV of the Politecnico di Milano.
